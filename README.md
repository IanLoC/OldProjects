# Old Projects

This repository is a archive of old Flash projects scripted using ActionScript between 2013 and 2015.

While the original .swf and .fla files are completely unedited, short new embed html files are added to properly frame the flash players
in a window for interaction.

<i>reviewing note: as of migrating my old flash portfolio to github, it is notible that [Light Warp Pong](https://github.com/IanLoC/OldProjects/tree/master/Light%20Warp%20Pong) does not work correctly as the paddle speeds are significantly less. controls are not explicitly stated, but are:
<br/>z,x,c for player 1 
<br/>and
<br/><,>,? for player 2
<br/>for up, down, slow-mode respectively

Light Warp Pong should move at near uncontrollable speeds where the slow-mode is used to "warp" into position and evade the bumper random speed changing vortex in the center.</i>

<i>excluded project: <u>seizure.fla</u>,<u>seizure.swf</u>,<u>seizure.html</u> as it is unsafe for people with epilepsy, and much more intense than [Party Star](https://github.com/IanLoC/OldProjects/tree/master/Party%20Star)</i>
